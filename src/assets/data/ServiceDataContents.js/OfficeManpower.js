        Outsourcing manpower is not a new phenomenon, but it has gained
        significant momentum in recent years. Both private and public sector
        organizations, including government establishments, are adopting
        outsourcing practices effectively and efficiently. More organizations
        are embracing it as a solution to protect against inefficiencies, high
        replacement costs, compliance issues, and the complexities of labor
        laws.

        Many people confuse hiring manpower with outsourcing. When you outsource
        work to a third party, they handle the job on your behalf and charge you
        on an hourly, monthly, or assignment basis. However, when you hire
        manpower, the resource functions similarly to an employee but on a
        contractual basis. Hiring manpower services is often a better option
        than outsourcing work in both the short and long term due to the
        following factors:

      <div className="mb-3">
        <ul>
          <li>It is often more cost-effective than outsourcing.</li>
          <li>It gives you complete control over the hired resource.</li>
          <li>
            Hired manpower can work in a customized way, using your systems and
            software
          </li>
          <li>
            You have the flexibility to hire as many people as you need for as

        the freedom to hire according to your needs. You can hire manpower on a
        monthly retainer basis with no restrictions on the number of people or
        the duration of the contract. Although temp staff and manpower services
        are similar in nature, manpower services encompass a broader concept,
        including temp staff within its scope.
