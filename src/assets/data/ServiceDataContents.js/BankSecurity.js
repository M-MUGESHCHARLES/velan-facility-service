        The banking sector was the first industry in India to deploy
        professional security. Protecting banks and financial institutions is
        crucial, and private security services play a vital role in safeguarding
        these assets.
      </p>
      <p className='my-3'>
        Banks rely on physical security measures such as CCTV, alarm systems,
        strong rooms, and most importantly, trained security guards. These
        guards, whether armed or unarmed, provide a visible deterrent to
        potential threats. They are trained to act swiftly and effectively,
        contacting the police if necessary.

        At Velan Facility Services, we provide specialized training for security
        personnel assigned to banks. This includes protocols for robbery
        prevention, managing entry points, and securing teller counters. Our
        guards are trained to ensure that no unauthorized individuals enter
        restricted zones.

        ATM security is equally important. Guards stationed at ATMs are trained
        to monitor activities, ensuring that:
      </p>
      <ul className='mb-3'>
        <li>No one covers their face with helmets, caps, or veils.</li>
        <li>Mobile phones are not used inside the ATM.</li>
        <li>Only one person is allowed inside at a time.</li>
        <li>No one lingers for an extended period.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className='my-3'>
        Velan Facility Services ensures 24/7 vigilance through constant
        monitoring of guard activity via a mobile app. We understand the unique
        security requirements of banks and ATMs and are committed to delivering
        reliable, vigilant protection.
