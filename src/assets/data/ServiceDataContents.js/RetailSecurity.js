        We provide security for retail stores, whether located in malls or
        standalone. Our security guards ensure that no merchandise leaves
        without proper authorization. They greet customers, manage the baggage
        counter, and check items against the bill without needing to inspect
        individual products. Guards also patrol the store and provide night-time
        protection against theft.

      <h5 className='fw-bold my-4'>Mall and Shopping Complex Security</h5>
      <p className="my-3">
        In malls, security focuses on access control to prevent any threats.
        Duties include frisking, baggage and vehicle checks, crowd control, and
        maintaining clear passageways. Our guards respond to emergencies and
        ensure the safety of all patrons.
      </p>
        <h5 className='fw-bold my-4'>Multiplex and Theatre Security</h5>
      <p className="my-3">
        Our guards ensure that only ticket holders enter the premises, control
        crowds, and prevent banned substances from being carried in. They also
        assist during emergencies, including fire safety, disaster management,
        and first aid.
