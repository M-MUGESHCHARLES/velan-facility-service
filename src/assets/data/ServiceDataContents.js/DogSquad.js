        Our squad features highly trained German Shepherds, Dobermans, and
        Labradors, alongside skilled handlers. The presence of our dog squads
        acts as a powerful deterrent and adds a premium touch to any event.
        These squads are effective for perimeter patrol, facility searches, and
        intruder detection.

        <h5 className='my-4 fw-bold'>Security Dog Training</h5>
      <p className='my-3'>
        Our training begins with essential obedience to ensure dogs are
        disciplined and responsive. We use clear commands that dogs can
        understand and act upon, while also managing their natural aggression.
        Endurance and agility training prepare dogs to execute commands
        effectively, even in crowded situations.

        various high-profile events and VIP protection.
