        <h4 className='mt-4 fw-bold'>Role of Female Security Guards</h4>
      <p className='mb-3'>
        Female security guards are often seen as approachable, bringing a calm
        presence to situations that could otherwise escalate. Their role is
        essential in locations with predominantly female visitors and children,
        but their abilities extend far beyond that. Female guards are equally
        skilled in performing all security tasks with the same efficiency and
        dedication as their male counterparts, offering a sense of safety to
        women.
