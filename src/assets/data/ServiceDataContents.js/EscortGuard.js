        Many workplaces where female employees work late hours or night shifts
        must provide pick-up and drop services with an escort guard to ensure
        their safety. This requirement is mandated by various state laws,
        ensuring the safety of female employees in transit.

        In metro cities, it&rsquo;s common for female employees to work late,
        making our escort security service highly sought after by companies.

        Escort guards require specialized skills, as their role involves
        safeguarding employees during transit, often under unique circumstances.
